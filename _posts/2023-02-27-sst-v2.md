SST v2 is ready. Here's what's new and how you can learn more about it.

## What is SST v2

We completely rewrote SST to be simpler, faster, and easier to work with. [Check out this video](https://youtu.be/v97-SJY1Mb0) to get a quick sense of what SST v2 is all about.

Adam and Dax also did a whole [podcast episode on SST v2](https://tomorrow.fm/8) and the rewrite process.

We also did a [launch livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6oqlnY6-Vc) where we talked about what's new in v2, how to upgrade, and deep dive into the new codebase. We also answered some questions from the community.

## Upgrade to v2

In general most of the changes are ergonomic and it should be a pretty simple upgrade process. Check out our docs for the [**upgrade guide**]({{ site.docs_url }}/upgrade-guide#upgrade-to-v20).

## Features

Here's a quick rundown of the major changes.

- **Monopackage**

  The first major change is that we are moving to a new npm package — [**`sst`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sst)

  We are also moving to a monopackage architecture. So instead of installing `@serverless-stack/cli` or `@serverless-stack/resources`; you simply need to install `sst`.

  All the constructs can be imported from `sst/constructs`. And the Node client is under `sst/node`.

- **New CLI**

  This new package also powers a brand new CLI. It's faster and has a cleaner UI to go with it.

  ```bash
  SST v2.0.38  ready!

  → App:     my-sst-app
    Stage:   Jay
    Console: https://console.sst.dev/my-sst-app/Jay

  ✓ Deployed:
    Database
    Api
    API: https://4f574d6lqc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    Web
    SITE: https://localhost:3000
  ```

- **Faster Live Lambda**

  We've reworked how [Live Lambda]({{ site.docs_url }}/live-lambda-development) works! It's a lot faster than before and it does not need to deploy any new infrastructure for it. So no more _Debug Stack_!

  You can [read more about the changes here]({{ site.docs_url }}/live-lambda-development#how-it-works).

- **`sst.config.ts`**

  We've also changed how you configure your SST apps. We've replaced the old `sst.json` with a `sst.config.ts`.

  ```typescript
  export default {
    config(_input) {
      return {
        name: "my-sst-app",
        region: "us-east-1",
      };
    },
    stacks(app) {
      app.stack(Database).stack(Api).stack(Web);
    },
  } satisfies SSTConfig;
  ```

  You can [read more about the new config here]({{ site.docs_url }}/configuring-sst).

- **New frontends**

  With SST v2, we've upgraded support for all the modern frontends out there. Our [`NextjsSite`]({{ site.docs_url }}/constructs/NextjsSite) construct supports Next.js 13, thanks to our new [OpenNext](https://open-next.js.org) project.

  We also added a [`AstroSite`]({{ site.docs_url }}/constructs/AstroSite) construct for [Astro](https://astro.build) and the [`SolidStartSite`]({{ site.docs_url }}/constructs/SolidStartSite) construct for [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com).

- **pnpm support**

  SST now natively supports [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)! Our new monorepo templates are now built to work with pnpm as well.

- _**And more...**_

  There's also a new cleaned up functions API, a better way to generate types, and more. For all the details check out this preview of SST v2 we did recently.
