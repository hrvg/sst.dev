In case you find yourself having problems with a certain step, we want to make sure that we are around to help you fix it and figure it out. There are a few ways to get help.

- We also have a very active [Discord]({{ site.discord_invite_url }}) community. If you have a question, start a new thread in the `#help` channel.

- We use [Discourse forum topics]({{ site.forum_url }}) as our comments and we've helped resolve quite a few issues in the past. So make sure to check the comments under each chapter to see if somebody else has run into the same issue as you have.

This entire guide is hosted on [GitHub]({{ site.github_repo }}). So if you find an error you can always:

- Open a [new issue]({{ site.github_repo }}/issues/new)
- Or if you've found a typo, edit the page and submit a pull request!

We recommend you start by [joining us on Discord]({{ site.discord_invite_url }})!
