Let's first get started by creating an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account. Of course you can skip this if you already have one. Head over to the [AWS homepage](https://aws.amazon.com){:target="_blank"} and create your account.

Next we'll configure your account so it's ready to be used for the rest of our guide.
